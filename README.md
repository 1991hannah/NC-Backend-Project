# Northcoders News API

Run the following in the terminal to get setup:
npm i 

If you wish to clone this project and run it locally, you will need to add the following two hidden files to this repo:

<.env.development>   - once created, link it to the relevant database by adding the following to the first line of the file: PGDATABASE=nc_news
<.env.test>    - once created, link it to the relevant database by adding the following to the first line of the file: PGDATABASE=nc_news_test

Finally, add these two files to .gitignore so they remain hidden.
